Rock Paper Scissors Game 

Problem Set 2 from CS32 at Harvard University taught by Professor Mike Smith 

The process to comeplete this task involved hard coding the game at first and then creating a server/user software. 
There are two different types of server/user. A smart server and dumb user; the server computes and outputs who wins 
the game based on what the user inputs. The user is considered "dumb" as they are not doing any computations. The user is simply inputting "rock, paper or scissors" and recieves 
the outcome; win or lose. There is then the dumb server and smart user where the user asks the computer for their choice and 
compares it to the user's inputted choice. The user then tells the server the outcome.
